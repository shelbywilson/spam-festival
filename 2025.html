              is built on field recordings that I have been gathering at and near sinkholes to
              compose a speculative field recording that imagines an underground, vibration and resonance-driven kinship
              among sinkholes of the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              I imagine aural and sensual links between sinkholes. Those who have been nearby as sinkholes opened up
              comment on the sound that precedes the sinkhole's appearance. Some describe it as a guttural growl, while
              others comment on the unfamiliarity of the sound until they realize where it emerged from. On the one
              hand,
              the sounds described are not sounds of the sinkhole but rather the sounds of the sinkhole's emergence, a
              moment preceding the cognizance of the thing. On the other hand, the memory of these sounds and their
              description afterward is inevitably linked to what exists as a hole in the ground, a physical collapse, a
              defamiliarizing of the ground we tread. With this work, I listen to the field recordings of sinkholes
              alongside my imagination of what the moments of collapse could have sounded like. I listen to the
              sinkholes
              as collapse.

            <p>
              In my work, I consider the discourse around the sudden and unexpected appearance of sinkholes as a tool to
              continue the practices of slow violence; the treatment of this landscape phenomenon mirrors the lack of
              accountability that institutions have adopted as an unofficial policy. By looking at the temporality of
              collapse and catastrophe in the landscape, I produce a framework that conceptualizes a reckoning with the
              ongoing, constant state of catastrophe, tracing apparatuses across languages, physical phenomena, and
              actions.
            </p>
            <p>
              To achieve these goals, I use sound-driven installations and terrestrial radio transmissions. I sense that
              to be in public space, now, is to insist on the speculative. I actively imagine listening as an
              intervention
              beyond considering it as an epistemological and ontological tool to situate it as an ongoing state.
            </p>
            <p>
              As an artist, I work around methods of tuning in. I think through the media of photography, video, radio,
              sound, performance, and site-specific installations. I am currently pursuing a PhD in Film and Digital
              Media
              Studies at University of California Santa Cruz, with a designated emphasis in History of Consciousness. I
              am
              also the founding editor of m-est.org, an artist-driven publication.

              is an interactive web installation that explores the boundaries of commoning in the age of
              AI. The work invites participants to contemplate the hypothetical exchange of their most personal
              experiences, spaces, and relationships through a series of AI-generated questions.
            </p>
            <p>
              The installation consists of a digital experience where users anonymously share what they would be willing
              to exchange—from pets and spouses to memories and traumas. These responses are processed by a large
              language
              model that continuously generates a narrative, imagining a day in a world of increasingly communal and
              shared resources. Each answer directly informs this evolving story, which reflects participants'
              collective
              input about the limits of sharing.

              This ongoing conversation about intimacy and its boundaries in our networked age questions where we draw
              the
              line between private and communal, using AI as both medium and metaphor to explore our evolving
              relationship
              with privacy, ownership, and collective experience.
            <p>
              This collaborative work explores the systems that shape our evolving relationship with privacy, ownership,
              and collective experience in the age of AI. We work at the intersection of participatory design and
              speculative futures, revealing how technological acceleration transforms our most intimate boundaries.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="highlight">Intimate Commons</span>
              rejects the idea that personal and communal are opposites. Instead, we blur these lines
              through an interactive installation that asks participants what they would share—pets, memories, spouses,
              traumas—in exchange for connection. These anonymous responses feed an AI system that generates a
              continuous
              narrative, imagining life in a world of increasingly shared resources.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through this project, we create ways for people to engage with abstract concepts of digital commoning
              through visceral, personal choices. The work functions as both experiment and proposal, testing
              alternative
              modes of connection that transcend traditional boundaries between private and collective life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Like Conway's Law suggests systems reflect their creators' communication patterns, bringing participatory
              artistic practices into AI frameworks transforms both process and output. The evolving narrative becomes a
              mirror of collective values while proposing unconventional ideas about intimacy and exchange.
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe the most interesting works emerge from unexpected intersections—where systematic inquiry and
              aesthetic experience strengthen each other to reveal how overlapping technological and social systems
              shape
              our shared futures.

              is a two-channel 3D animation that explores different states of consciousness, inner
              disorientation, and the oscillation between the imaginary and the real. At its core is a digital model of
              an urban space based on the Frankfurt underground system and extracted from a video game simulation. This
              environment provides the backdrop for a fragmented journey through memories and subconscious associations.
            </p>
            <p>
              The piece reflects the tension between physical movement and mental projection, and between simulation and
              introspection. It evokes the strange sensation of being in a familiar place yet feeling lost, wandering
              through one's own body as if under external control and detached from space and time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Scenes unfold with a dreamlike logic, featuring moonlit streets, animal-like figures, and fleeting
              encounters drawn from memory. These elements merge into monochrome spaces where meaning hovers just out of
              reach. The soundscape, constructed from natural recordings, is closely tied to each environment through
              loose, intuitive links.

              The term

              subconscious fragments surface in dreams. Like details that linger briefly after waking before fading, the
              work traces an inner landscape where clarity slips between moments of recognition and disorientation.

              Starting from casual encounters or everyday observations, he transforms these fragments by shifting their

              This is an autonomously-walking death meditation. In it, the player is wandering lost in a
              semi-wilderness,
              on the edge of a once-inhabited environment. They go from area to area, trees, marsh, empty roads, in each
              place experiencing the world through their senses as well as their thoughts. They also sometimes encounter
              bodies on the ground. Sometimes they bury these bodies. Occasionally they encounter mounds where someone
              or
              thing has been buried. They are wandering at night and at the break of dawn they lie down to sleep, dream,
              and then die. The position where they died is uploaded to a server to potentially be found and buried by
              another instance/repetition of the software, another 'player'.
            </p>
            <p>
              The server provides the memory of each play session, a life that transcends the death of each individual
              'player'. The individual dies and becomes a piece of shared data or an invisible web of relationships. A
              similar process happens in physical death as our bodies continue to be used by the environment without our
              agency.

              My work comes from a mix of autobiographical experience and theoretical experimentation. Exploring
              technical
              constraints and limitations helps me give shape to concepts and subjects that are not inherently
              technical.

            <p>
              My mediums tend to be videogames, interactive and non-interactive procedural software, and video, with the
              latter often using the former as material. I create work using game engines, various coding languages, 2D
              and 3D digital art creation software, and audio sampling.
            </p>
            <p>
              Simulations of instability, the overwhelming power of nature, post-human worlds and dissociation are
              themes
              I lean toward. They all come from a similar place, even if they produce different results. All of them can
              be seen as a form of rupture with our assumed control over our world and reality. There is a spiritual
              element of letting go or riding the discomfort.
            </p>
            <p>
              Exploring technical constraints and limitations helps me give shape to concepts and subjects that are not
              inherently technical. Recently, I have created procedural software work where, although I might have
              started
              with some interaction or game mechanics, I eventually reduced interaction to almost nothing. These works
              generally have some form of generative landscape and occasionally also artificially-intelligent
              non-playable
              characters whose behaviors one can observe.

              is an electromagnetic-kinetic sound sculpture and ritual performance on a living oak. The
              ritual frames the work: a practice of caretaking and shared attention that treats the tree as a sacred,
              living archive—a portal between spiritual and physical worlds, between ancestors and the present.
            </p>
            <p>
              Three pendulum antennas, each hung from a separate branch, form a triadic constellation around the trunk.
              This geometry holds harmonic symmetry and gentle dissonance, centering the tree as the anchor where
              natural,
              technological, and human rhythms meet.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each pendulum carries a small magnet bob above a floor-mounted coil. Acting as electromagnetic Aeolian
              harps, their motion gathers the site's invisible "winds" of radio energy; the swing imprints slow polarity
              changes and gentle Doppler bends onto the received spectrum. Each antenna feeds a software-defined radio;
              signals are shaped in SuperCollider and diffused on small speakers in a listening ring beyond the
              pendulums.
            </p>
            <p>
              The work moves between a quiet, all-day installation and a three-part ritual—Listening/Translation,

              is a research exploration centering on e-textile meta-materials, using the technique of
              Kirigami, a Japanese art-making process where flat paper is cut and folded to form 3-dimensional shapes.
              In this project, kirigami-inspired freestanding lace patterns have been designed in order to fabricate
              soft
              sculptural 3D antennas that are cognizant of their use and relation to space.
            </p>
            <p>
              With the progression of technology as integrated into daily life, physical tech has become increasingly
              embedded or hidden from the user's view. Because of this design change, many of the aesthetics that
              previously defined everyday technology have disappeared from the public eye. Our ability to connect the
              capability of technology with the spacial world it utilizes has disappeared with it. This notion is
              especially true for antenna design. An object that was once visible on cars, houses, and phones is now so
              embedded in the devices that use it that its technology is essentially formless.
              <span class="highlight">Kirigami Antennas</span>
              is a
              research exploration centering on e-textile meta-materials, designing antennas that are cognizant of their
              use and relation to space. This collection of antennas are not embedded nor hidden. They instead borrow
              from
              the art of Kirigami to re-insert themselves into the 3D space from which they receive their signals.
              Through
              experimentation with Kirigami antenna shapes, we are able to design freestanding lace antennas that
              effectively received electromagnetic signals at a wide range of frequencies, picking up AM, FM, and HAM
              radio, along with other data transmissions.

              My research focuses on the interweaving of art and science through the creation of artifacts with a
              critical
              lens. I see the praxis of crafting technological artifacts as an act of resistance against black box
              systems. One that contains embodied knowledge and carries with it oral histories of intergenerational
              practices. One that can transcend cultural and ethnic boundaries, and can be transmitted through direct
              engagement with materials. Likewise, I see the use of electronics, open software and hardware, and the act
              of creating collectively as means of cultivating digital commons that have the potential to empower
              individuals through shared knowledge. I believe that the ability to craft your own technology is a
              powerful
              tool for world building, one that enables you to speculate about alternative presents and plausible
              futures.

              invites festival visitors to confess their cravings to three AI deities of consumption—Gratis,
              Häfoff, and Luxior—inside the Georgetown Steam Plant. Each participant approaches an altar, scans its QR
              code, and enters a chat where the god probes purchase histories, bargain impulses, and luxury fantasies.
              The dialogue drives a projection-mapped reliquary that blossoms in real time, turning private desire into
              a
              shared spectacle. When the rite concludes, a thermal printer issues a "Proof of Purchase" receipt

              familiar swipes and taps into ritual gestures, exposing the sacred logics embedded in the wheels of

              reframes our everyday, mindless consumption as exultant worship to forces greater than us, and
              investigates
              what those forces might ask from us in return.

              <br />
              A multimedia interdisciplinary work drawing upon artists' collaborative perception of playing with
              multi-dimensionality. No time-travelling is allowed; however, the creation of their own reality is
              permitted. Artists wonder: will virtual reality still exist in a time where our reality has long been
              virtual?

              <span class="highlight">Jorge Ramos</span>
              is a Portuguese composer and sound artist based in London. His work spans solo, orchestral,
              choral, electronic, film, stage, and installation music, presented across Europe, Asia, and the Americas.
              Recent collaborators include the London Philharmonic Orchestra, ORA Singers, Calouste Gulbenkian

            <p>
              <span class="highlight">Ramos</span>
              is drawn to perception and psychoacoustics, crafting music that blends orchestration with electronics,
              machine learning, and AI. His hybrid aesthetic merges futuristic techniques with vintage textures and noir
              atmospheres, often inspired by overstimulating urban spaces and the clash of eras.
            </p>
            <p>
              He has participated in notable programs including ENOA (Gulbenkian Orchestra), Estúdios Victor Córdon,
              TalentLAB (Luxembourg), and ACTOR (Canada), and was mentored by artists such as Tania León and Roger
              Reynolds. He is the London Philharmonic Orchestra's Young Composer for 2024/25 and a CESEM ESML and ACTOR
              collaborator.

              Upcoming projects include An Aria for the Mallard, an installation with Rosana Antolí and Claire Rocha
              Santos (Gulbenkian Foundation), and Music for a Greek Museum, a permanent sound work for the Kotsanas
              Museum
              as part of the EUROMUSE project. His music seeks to create immersive, multisensory listening experiences.

              is a single-channel video work from my larger project
              <span class="highlight">Karvansaray/Khandaq</span>,
              which
              reimagines Iranian caravanserais as gendered architectures of passage, protection, and control. My focus
              is
              on caravanserais commissioned by female rulers—among the earliest infrastructures of hospitality—where
              openness and enclosure, movement and containment, coexisted.
            </p>
            <p>
              This video speculatively reconstructs the andaruni—the private interior realm historically reserved for
              women—through digital renderings, archival fragments, and forms drawn from my textile sculptures. The work
              unfolds as a slow passage through imagined architectural thresholds, evoking both bodily presence and
              absence. Projected across translucent fabric bodies, the imagery slips between material and immaterial,
              memory and interface.
            </p>
            <p>
              Presented within the industrial vastness of the Georgetown Steam Plant, this soft digital architecture
              creates a counterpoint to the site's monumental concrete and steel. The work stages an encounter between
              feminized, intimate space and institutional infrastructure—foregrounding the tension between visibility
              and
              concealment.

              Artist statement
            </h5>
            <p>
              I work across textiles, soft sculpture, video, and interactive media to explore how diasporic, gendered
              bodies move through architectures of control, care, and visibility. My practice inhabits the friction
              between material and immaterial, softness and code, tradition and technology. Rooted in personal and
              collective histories of displacement, it navigates the textures of cultural memory and the ruptures of
              migration.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am drawn to the convergence of fabric and digital media—not as aesthetic contrast, but as conceptual
              resistance. Embroidery, layering, and stitching, shaped by Iranian traditions and passed down through
              generations of women, carry embedded knowledge of survival and self-definition. In my work they become
              acts
              of reclamation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Digital media, often coded as disembodied and masculine, becomes a site of tenderness and disruption. By
              merging sewing with video, projection, sensors, and interactive systems, I create environments where
              fabric
              becomes screen, memory becomes interface, and the viewer's presence completes the work.
            </p>
            <p>
              My installations invite participation, slowness, and intimacy. They trace a lineage of marginalized
              experience while refusing containment, collapsing binaries that have long excluded bodies like mine.

            <p>In Hamlet, Ophelia’s grief and the decline of her mental health is due to the actions of men. In
              classical paintings, her violent death of drowning in the lake is portrayed as a calm and erotic
              peacefulness. What if, after Ophelia drowns in the lake, that she re-emerges from the water as a
              grief-stricken, angry siren. In this afterlife, how can Ophelia be laid to rest and finally be freed from
              her grief?

            <p>
              <span class="highlight">Sirin Speaks</span> emerged as a reflection on Ophelia, the artist’s fear of the

              an afterlife where Ophelia is powerful. The artist creates a self portrait that transforms the site of
              Ophelia’s demise, the water, as an extension of the body. An entity swimming in pixels.

              first
              person and third person. The plot adapts the story of the "Emperor's New Clothes" and Buddhist scriptures
              "Śūraṅgama Sūtra"; in the Emperor's New Clothes, the emperor is deceived into wearing invisible clothing,
              but in my story, the emperor voluntarily chooses to do so because he believes that memories from the
              cherished one are more important than luxurious garments made of jewels. As long as one believes, even in
              ruins, the treasures in one's heart will not disappear.

              <span class="highlight">Light Quilt</span>
              is a projection-mapped quilt, exploring the mathematical relationships of both patchwork
              quilting traditions and optical art. It consists of modular blocks made from cardboard and projection
              mapped
              animations.
            </p>
            <p>
              While patchwork quilts often create patterns through geometry and color, this quilt creates patterns
              through
              dimension as well. Using cardboard as our primary material is a nod to the practice of "foundation
              piecing"
              in patchwork quilting, in which paper is used to stabilize fabric as it is cut and sewn together.
            </p>
            <p>
              The projected animations highlight the physical geometry of each block, as well as the hidden geometries
              within the piece as a whole. The interplay of static forms and dynamic projections creates moments of
              visual
              harmony and ambiguity.

              <span class="highlight">Radiant Center</span>
              is a four-channel sound installation examining the convergence of security practices, media
              technologies, and geological environments at the Russian-Lithuanian border on the Curonian Spit, a
              peninsula
              along the southeastern Baltic Sea. Engaging with the site's cultural history as a UNESCO World Heritage
              Site
              known for its wind-blown sand dunes, the project investigates how borders and wind function as media
              infrastructures that are simultaneously local and global, geopolitical and ecological, mobile and
              emplaced.
              The methodology centers on embodied listening to the border's acoustic and transmission ecologies,
              informing
              the creation of documentary and performative recordings of radio communications, broadcasts, and
              electromagnetic emissions related to border security and atmospheric science, alongside field recordings
              that capture how aeolian forces resonate across the Spit's terrain. Bridging border studies, environmental
              humanities, and sound art practice during a period of heightened xenophobic border rhetoric across
              American
              and European contexts,
              "<span class="highlight">Radiant Center</span>"
              advances an understanding of borders as porous, contested zones
              where political, technological, and environmental forces continually reshape both human and non-human
              mobilities.

              is a Belarus-born artist based in Los Angeles whose work examines gender as an interface
              between subjects and the state, seeking to unsettle their regulatory logics. Using transmission arts,
              media
              installation, and performance, his practice is grounded in site-specific listening and sonic fiction
              methodologies.

              is an interactive installation that bridges art and technology to explore artificial life
              through data-driven video, system art, and live performance. Integrating machine learning based emotion
              recognition, the system captures and responds to participants' facial expressions in real-time.

              these robotic sculptures operate as autonomous digital beings that draw viewers
              into a form of active listening, gathering and loosely transcribing conversations in real-time from a

              engages with the greenhouse as a site where colonial desires, visual regimes, and
              plant life converge. I'm interested in how contemporary video technologies inherit and trouble the
              imperial
              impulse to categorise, possess, and display life. I'm seeking to interrogate visual capture technologies
              and
              the ways they continue to reproduce structures of control, while also offering space for resistance and re
              imagination. Central to this inquiry is the figure of the mediated plant (Teresa Castro), a botanical
              subject shaped not through direct observation, but through layers of technological translation,
              algorithmic
              vision, and colonial desire.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this developing work I'm moving between multiple contextual histories to invite non-western gestural
              and
              ritualistic modalities of being. The octopus cactus is filled with desire to transform beyond its
              environmental and bodily constraints towards a form (an octopus) filled with fluidity and motion. Its
              image
              acts as an allegory of the inherent disconnection and un belonging faced by both humans and non-humans as
              the mediated plant begins to offer a conception of the body-site as a space filled with potential for
              refuge
              and belonging. The images form and break open as ambient sounds hint at environmental tensions both inside
              and outside this being. The voice over provides contextual pathways and permeates queer botanical desire
              in
              between and inside each pixel.

              I'm an artist-curator and community worker from Bengaluru, India. Drawing from my aboriginal Dalit
              identity
              (Adi-Karnataka), I posit critical inquiries into the role of technology to create experiential bodies of
              works. I draw from traditions of anti-caste counter histories, resistance strategies & artistic forms
              preserved through folk tales, oral histories, ritualistic, sonic and movement practices. I work with a
              range
              of emergent media technologies like lidar sensors, photogrammetry, motion capture to employ the
              computational image as a counter-tactic to resisting assimilation into dominant cultural histories. My
              works
              unfold bi-lingually in Kannada & English and contain sonic atmospheres with dialogues, voice overs,
              readings
              and recitals accompanied by soundtracks incorporating caste specific instruments and musical traditions.

              reflects on the idea of portals as objects of intergenerational, interdimensional and celestial
              connections. It materializes through a series of knitted tapestries which depict Al-generated images of
              portals imagined as tunnels, or caves, or black holes. Each tapestry activates a sound recording of a
              composition of radio signals sourced from personal field recordings with handmade antennas, as well as
              open-source recordings from the Signal Wiki repository. The sounds are subtle and directional, as moving
              away from the tapestries they disappear.

              I chose to work with radio waves as they are both a natural phenomenon (electromagnetism exists everywhere
              in nature, the cosmos, our bodies, etc), but also a human made medium of communication. Radio has long
              been
              associated with extrasensorial activity; it is said that the first time that people heard AM radio they
              thought they were hearing voices from the past, and even to this day ghost detectors are primarily
              electromagnetic field detectors (radios that are tuned to a lower frequency than AM or FM). The use of
              textiles is a material choice that connects to the idea of embodied knowledge which carries histories of
              intergenerational practices, it refers to the multiplicity of bodies, and cultures that have inhabited
              this
              land, and it also symbolizes a way of physicalizing the fabric of spacetime.

              My research focuses on the interweaving of art and science through the creation of artifacts with a
              critical
              lens. I see the praxis of crafting technological artifacts as an act of resistance against black box
              systems. One that contains embodied knowledge and carries with it oral histories of intergenerational
              practices. One that can transcend cultural and ethnic boundaries, and can be transmitted through direct
              engagement with materials. Likewise, I see the use of electronics, open software and hardware, and the act
              of creating collectively as means of cultivating digital commons that have the potential to empower
              individuals through shared knowledge. I believe that the ability to craft your own technology is a
              powerful

              This piece is comprised of a series of short, distinct sections. Each one operates as a kind of
              microcosm—an
              experiment in texture, behavior, and rhythm that gestures toward its own internal logic. Inspired by Yuk
              Hui's concept of cosmotechnics—the idea that all technologies are rooted in particular cosmologies—I treat
              each section as an exploration of a possible world. These are not discrete vignettes, but technological
              cosmologies, each offering a glimpse into a different way of relating to time, space, and sound.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rather than viewing technology as a neutral tool or a vehicle for control, I approach it as a relational
              and
              expressive medium. The modular synthesizer becomes a site of indeterminacy and emergence, where sound is
              sculpted through contingent feedback loops. The generative visuals embody these unseen forces—shifting,
              pulsing, reacting in ways that are never fully knowable in advance.

              My practice is mediated by data, light, and sound, resulting in work that weaves together code,
              installation, and sculpture to explore the complex intersections of queerness, identity, and place. Rooted
              in fluidity, transition, and transformation, my practice unfolds as a network of processes—each piece a
              moment within a larger, generative system of connection and reflection.

            <p>
              A central concept in my work is the idea of the sub-grid, inspired by computational models in physical
              simulations. In these systems, the sub-grid represents phenomena occurring at scales too small to be
              captured by the simulation's resolution, yet whose impacts reverberate throughout the larger structure. My
              art explores this interstitial space, revealing the unseen forces, subtleties, and complexities that drive
              transformation in both personal and collective contexts.

              I am fascinated by the ways that technology can tell on itself and its social contexts. I work with
              collections of media, much of it government-produced. I seek out residue that might surface details about
              the institutions and infrastructures the media comes from (and through). These projects function in
              real-time, computationally "working" to organize and analyze gaps in intelligibility in these corpora.
              This
              "work" is less to solve a problem by closing these gaps than to articulate a poetics in the spaces between
              sense-making and the unintelligible.

              <span class="highlight">The Hug</span>
              is a short video essay reflecting the anticipated loss of the artist's grandmother. Mimicking the
              aesthetics of quick online tutorials and digital workflows, it explores themes of digital autonomy,
              consent,
              and the role of posthumous technology in grief. Using photogrammetry and motion capture as a way of
              memorialization, the artist choreographs a hug between herself and her grandmother. The workflow,
              developed
              over the course of a year, reveals a lack of intimacy in the making through 3D scans that smoothen
              wrinkles,
              movement locked in time and space, and a virtual body that responds to the artist. The piece confronts the
              fact that a virtual body will never be felt, if not only by virtual hands.

              <span class="highlight">Last One Standing: In Search of Myths at a State of Apocalypse</span>
              is an interactive speculative fiction project
              that explores how myth can help us make sense of ecological collapse. Inspired by the 2024 landslides in
              Wayanad, Kerala, the work reimagines Hindu mythological figures, Garuda and Varaha, not as distant
              deities,
              but as grounded, flawed beings navigating a post-disaster landscape.
            </p>
            <p>
              The project examines the land as both witness and participant in ongoing climate trauma. Garuda,
              traditionally seen as a divine scavenger, becomes a symbol of labour and survival amidst debris. Varaha,
              the
              cosmic boar who once lifted the Earth, reflects on regeneration and the limits of rebuilding. These mythic
              characters narrate from the landscape, offering more-than-human perspectives rooted in memory, grief, and
              cultural inheritance.
            </p>
            <p>
              Drawing from speculative fabulation, oral traditions, and ecological research,
              <span class="highlight">Last One Standing</span>
              builds a
              counter-archive of a land in crisis where broken tools, forgotten objects, and fading stories become
              carriers of meaning. The work questions how we remember places marked by disaster and asks what myths can
              teach us in the face of irreversible change.
            </p>
            <p>
              The project engages with themes of cultural memory, ecological grief, and speculative futures, inviting
              audiences to reflect on what remains and how we choose to carry it forward.

            <p>
              I am a multidisciplinary Indian artist and researcher currently pursuing an MA in Interaction Design at
              the
              University of the Arts London. My practice explores how we remember places and how our relationships with
              them are shaped through memory, ecological change, and systems of power.
            </p>
            <p>
              I use anarchiving to preserve non-verbal, embodied, and emotional forms of knowledge that are often left
              undocumented. My interest lies in what archives do not record and how that absence affects our
              understanding
              of culture, land, and history. By working with non-linear counter-archives, I explore how storytelling can
              offer alternative ways of relating to place and memory.
            </p>
            <p>
              My recent projects examine oral traditions that are fading, reframe mythological symbols in the context of
              environmental disasters, and question missing data in militarised regions like the Siachen Glacier. I use
              methods such as counter-mapping, digital reconstruction, and interactive storytelling to foreground voices
              and perspectives often left out of mainstream narratives.
            </p>
            <p>
              Inspired by thinkers like Donna Haraway, I consider how knowledge is always situated and how the personal
              and political are deeply intertwined. My work sits between memory and data, fact and fiction, individual
              and
              collective, inviting others to reflect on what is remembered, what is lost, and what can still be
              reimagined.

              These micro-narratives imagine future built environments in which algorithmic design and artificial
              intelligence have blurred the lines between physical and virtual in landscapes, cities, and architectures.
              Here, the repeated form of the tetrapod indicates a boundary between technology and nature, between a
              fight
              to protect the land and a surrender to monotonous uniformity. A paranoid narrative is recited by an
              equally
              monotonous voice, and a landscape of physical and virtual tetrapods is rendered absurdly small in scale.

              is an artist and educator working across visual culture and technology. Based in Seattle (US),
              his work critically explores representation and communication in the context of digital culture and asks:
              how do we see, inhabit, feel, and talk about these new forms of exchange? How do we approach creativity
              within the digital? What are the poetics, narratives, and visual languages inherent in new information

            <p>
              With a mechanical shudder, my suspended head stirs to life. Projected across its surface, my face begins
              to
              speak: a childhood memory unfolds. A memory half-performed, half-possessed.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the background a hacked Skeever from the world of Elder Scrolls: Skyrim emerges as a giant printed rat,
              part digital beast, part sculptural spectre. It echoes the Qarakorshaq, a creature of Turkic folklore that
              lives in shadow—part myth, part mnemonic.
            </p>
            <p>
              This installation is a theatre of hauntings. It asks what it means to animate memory, to stage the self as
              artifact. A single coin activates the loop: personal history delivered like an arcade confession, fleeting
              and transactional. The audience becomes witness, accomplice and ghost. The spectre is transferred.
            </p>
            <p>
              I draw on the language of games, folk monsters and gothic discourse to fold past and present into a
              sculptural gesture. The uncanny body speaks; the machine remembers. In this fragile choreography of light,
              sound, and plastic, something intimate lingers - half-finished, half-felt - on the edge of forgetting.

              My practice moves across video, installation, sculpture, and interactive media to explore memory,
              displacement, and the politics of visibility. As a second-generation British Turk from a working-class
              background, I draw from personal and intergenerational histories to examine how trauma, identity, and
              belonging are mediated through technology and image-making.
            </p>
            <p>
              Informed by a prospective nomadic lineage, I consider how digital worlds—game environments, interactive
              fiction, and virtual architectures—can be mapped and integrated into memory and the embodied experience of
              space. These terrains become sites of both rupture and repair, where generational trauma and identity
              shock
              may be navigated and reimagined.
            </p>
            <p>
              My recent works incorporate 3D printing, mechatronics, and AI-generated material to question machinic
              perception and cultural bias. I build speculative, temporal spaces—interactive installations or playable
              fictions—where hauntology and queer temporalities unsettle linear narratives.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through layered soundscapes and tactile media, I explore how the janky, the incomplete, and the hand-made
              offer resistance to systems of speed, polish, and disposability. My work seeks to build maps—psychic,
              political, and emotional—that trace alternate routes through past and future worlds, asking how we might
              hold space for healing through the shifting architectures of memory.

              Using digital techniques I want to question the transformation of bodies in space and time. I want to
              focus
              on the relationship between devices as metaphors for the way in which human animals communicate with and
              within the environment. I am interested in the fleeting and the enduring as starting points for creation.
              That is why my work moves between the materiality of data, the use of the internet, intervening open
              access
              codes and the re-signification of devices in space and time.I like to appropriate my digital footprint
              towards a 'neo-footprint' generated by my mutant and organic steps product of a conscious (in)volution of
              a
              technified being. I like to see my creations as a visit to the infinity of 1 and 0, mediating between the
              real and the fictional, and also between the organic and the digital. As a contemporary artist, I am
              interpellated by the use of technology, which is why the materiality of my work focuses on the use of
              technology reinterpreted in search of a connection with others from a new and collective place. I could
              say
              that my intention is to move towards a pixelated embrace in a technified present.

              framing the event solely as a triumph of human achievement, the work reflects on humanity's nature within

              but

              juxtaposes handmade textile landscapes with AI-driven ecosystem simulations, questioning
              the relationship between manual and automated labor, human and non-human intelligence.
            </p>
            <p>
              The physical component of
              <span class="highlight">Bug in My Software</span>
              is a soft textile landscape. The visual patterns of the textile
              are derived from the silkmoth's DNA sequence, functioning both as a blueprint and a historical document of
              the species' anthropogenic transformation. Though the textile's design is informed by algorithmic
              processes,
              its materiality and construction are the result of manual, repetitive labor, performed by the artist over
              several months. This juxtaposition of handcraft and computational automation highlights the dynamics of
              hidden labor behind both traditional and digital production systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              A speculative AI-driven ecosystem simulation unfolds in real time atop the textile landscape, populated by
              digital bugs— the silkmoths, silkworms and their digital ecosystem.Through XR headsets and multiple
              screens,
              visitors can observe the bugs' behaviors, interactions, and life cycles as they evolve, explore, live,
              find
              food, socialize, procreate and transform their digital ecosystem. This simulation runs outside of the
              artistic control, and bugs evolve and change their appearance, transform their environment, and
              occasionally
              react and follow the visitors as they explore the hybrid digital/textile landscape. For the
              <span class="highlight">SPAM New Media Festival</span>,
              I am interested in advancing the simulation by adding more interactivity and complexity to the
              simulation, by introducing real time data and more species within the simulated speculative ecosystem.
            </p>
            <p>
              The visitors are invited to embed (or re-embed) themselves into the speculative garden: find a position,
              feel the ground, envelop in the landscape, contemplate, cuddle, and rest in this hybrid landscape

            <p>
              <span class="highlight">Alina Nazmeeva</span>
              is a Tatarstan-born media artist and educator whose practice explores the material, cultural,
              and political dimensions of technology. Her work integrates digital simulations and video games with
              textiles and physical installation as both storytelling devices and as sites of critique. With these
              diverse
              media,
              <span class="highlight">Alina</span>
              constructs complex worlds that interrogate how technologies, both emerging and established,
              shape the ways of knowing, living and becoming - for both humans and non-humans.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="highlight">Alina</span>'s
              work is attentive to seductive and destructive potentials embedded within technological imaginaries.
              Approaching technology as a situated and relational practice,
              <span class="highlight">Alina</span>
              seeks to hijack, hack, and reimagine
              existing computational systems and their material manifestations, towards the project of other
              technologies
              rooted in the ideas of cyberfeminism, cosmotechnics, and pluriverse. Her works intervene into complex
              situated technological processes to examine their legacies, inherent violence, and contradictory promises.
            </p>
            <p>
              Her installation
              <span class="highlight">Bug in My Software</span>
              juxtaposes handwoven textile landscapes with AI-driven ecosystem
              simulations, questioning the relationship between manual and automated labor, human and non-human
              intelligence. Pre-game shifts focus to embodiment and spectatorship, using football culture as a lens to
              investigate gender, bodies, and digital multiplicity.
