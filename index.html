          Organized and curated by our team of community art workers, this year's selection of works includes
          mediations on borders, on commons, on deep time, and on bodies, a video game
          about caretaking, a VR
          experience about climate, and a surveilling balloon. We have slime moulds, sink holes, post-apocalyptic
          landscapes, and something lurking in the&nbsp;boiler.

        <p class="large">
          We are a collective of artists and researchers who are building an annual festival in Seattle as a
          space
          for critical discourse around digital culture and technology-driven art.
        </p>
        <p>

          Initiated within the University of Washington's DXARTS department, <span class="highlight">SPAM</span> is a
          Seattle based experimental arts festival which brings together practitioners working on the
          fringes
          and frontiers of new media art and knowledge production. Taking place at various venues across
          Seattle,
          the yearly festival consists of a program of exhibitions, performances, workshops and discussions
          rooted
          in, or emerging from, technology driven art and digital culture. This includes, but is not limited
          to,
          the projects of artists and researchers working within the fields of AI, robotics, sound,
          experimental
          video, VR, wearable technology, photogrammetry and radio.
        </p>
        <p>
          We want to be a bug in the system, resisting the dominance of capital driven media culture through
          multiplicity and difference, through embodiment and critical practice. <span class="highlight">SPAM</span> is
          also about regrowth
          in
          the wake of ruin, reconstitution and persistence through hard times. We are interested in ideas of
          collectivity, possibility, commonality and queerness. As a collaboration of artists looking to
          address
          these ways of being, we hope to leave breadcrumbs, to create pathways of interconnectivity, and make
          traces for our future selves.
