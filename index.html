          Organized and curated by our team of community art workers, this year's selection of works includes
          mediations on borders, on commons, on deep time, and on bodies, a video game
          about caretaking, a VR
          experience about climate, and a surveilling balloon. We have slime moulds, sink holes, post-apocalyptic
          landscapes, and something lurking in the&nbsp;boiler.

          We are a collective of artists and researchers who are building <span class="highlight">SPAM</span> New Media
          Festival as a space in Seattle
          for critical discussion around digital culture and technology-driven art, bringing together practitioners
          working from a postdigital&nbsp;perspective.
        </p>
        <p>Approaching its third iteration, the yearly festival consists of a
          program of installations, performances, workshops and discussions, which have taken place at various art
          venues in Seattle. Festival events sit at the intersection of algorithmic art, moving image, immersive art,
          data-driven installations, robotics and more, and showcase experimental and novel ways to critically engage
          with a technologically mediated world. We look not only to create discourse around the intersection of art and
          technology, but ask how this crossover might raise important questions in regards to socio-political and
          ecological&nbsp;relations.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2023 we launched the first <span class="highlight">SPAM</span> New Media Festival—a curated program of
          exhibitions and performances which
          presented the work of DXARTS PhD students across various Seattle venues. <span
            class="highlight">SPAM's</span> 2023 Summer/Fall program began
          with an outdoor activation of Freeway Park, as part of the Downtown ARTS Recovery Program for 2023. Following
          this event, there was a series of free and open to the public performances and exhibitions throughout the
          month of October. For this first year’s program, <span class="highlight">SPAM</span> collaborated with Henry
          Art Gallery, Mini Mart City
          Park, Method Gallery, Gallery 4Culture, Jack Straw Cultural Center, Georgetown Steam Plant and Meany Hall at
          the University of&nbsp;Washington.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the second iteration of the festival, in September 2024, <span class="highlight">SPAM</span> manifested as
          a three-day event at
          Georgetown Steam Plant, where we exhibited the work of over 30 artists and included 25 installations and two
          nights of performances. Following our wonderful partnership last year with the organization, <span
            class="highlight">SPAM</span> 2025 is
          again hosted by Steam&nbsp;Plant.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="highlight">SPAM</span> New Media Festival is a volunteer run initiative. Our team of community
          art workers is made up of
          artists, curators, writers, designers, and&nbsp;technologists.
